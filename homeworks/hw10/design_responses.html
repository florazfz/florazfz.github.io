						<li>
							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p>I found the article quite intriguing, and I agree with Hick's Law, which posits that the more choices one has, the longer it takes to make a decision. 
								This piece has genuinely influenced my thought process. Now, when examining a piece of work or a website, I contemplate what the designer 
								is attempting to emphasize and consider how they could have executed it more effectively. Moreover, I gained insights into the 
								three types of attention: selective attention (the act of choosing to focus or not on something), 
								divided attention (juggling focus between two or more tasks simultaneously, such as driving and talking), 
								and sustained attention (maintaining focus on a single task for an extended period).

							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article and why?</p>
							<p> I would rate this article a perfect 10. The concept of the cocktail effect, which refers to the ability to focus on a single voice and filter out others in a crowded setting, struck me as quite amusing.
								I find it intriguing because I had never considered this as a human skill, given that our brains perform this task automatically. </p>
