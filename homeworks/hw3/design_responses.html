							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something interesting I learned is that there are main parts we need to consider in typography, 
								which are: identifying your purpose, identifying your audience, and looking for inspiration. 
								I also learned that when choosing typefaces, it's important to keep in mind the principles of 
								readability, legibility, and purpose. This is because who and how we want our design to appear 
								to the audience determine if our design is successful or not. </p>
						</li>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was looking at the different designs and being able to see how 
								the fonts caused the audience to focus on the intended meaning of the design. I loved seeing how 
								the different scaled ratios changed the output of the design, making me realize that typography 
								is all about analyzing for the perfect fit. Furthermore, I also enjoyed clicking on the reference 
								links to explore the different font types available for designers to use. </p>
