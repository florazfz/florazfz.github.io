        <p>Hi! My name is Flora and I love being outdoors. If you're ever bored and want to go on an adventure, whether that be hiking, 
            biking, swimming, skateboarding, or perhaps even skydiving, just let me know, and we'll do it together! Also, I love eating sweets,
            so if you ever want to go on a 12 am McFlurry run, just call me, and I'll pop up at your door ASAP! </p>

             <p><strong>Part 2: Reading Responses</strong></p>
             <ul>
                <li>Something I learned from this article is that all apps follow a deliberate design approach to ensure user-friendly navigation. 
                    Moreover, text elements are strategically incorporated to engage the audience, and every piece of text serves a specific purpose. 
                </li>
                <li>I particularly enjoyed observing the gradual assembly of components in the article, which illustrated the unique 
                    design principles behind Airbnb, Twitter, and Spotify. It allowed me to delve into the rationale 
                    behind the specific design choices for each app and witness how all the elements seamlessly came together.</li>
                <li>" By routinely analyzing other apps, you'll develop your product thinking and get better at designing apps yourself."</li>
