						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>Something I learned from this article is that white space is beneficial, and it not only helps improve focus but also enhances visual organization and readability. Now, whenever I open up a website, 
								I notice the small details in spacing and take note of how it's used so I can apply it to my own work in the future. Furthermore, I've come to appreciate people who design websites because their work actually helps determine 
								if a user would want to buy from a site or not. 
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I loved reading about the common concerns around white space. This part of the article allowed me to critique myself, think differently, and understand the reasons behind why white space is beneficial. After this passage, 
								I will remind myself that white space is good and will always consider using more white space whenever I'm designing something.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>“When in doubt, add more white space”</p>
						</li>
